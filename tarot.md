Here I present my personal system of Tarot. One hundred and eleven cards, with seven suits, ten pip cards and two court cards per suit, and twenty seven trumps, seven of which can alternatively be counted as court cards.

#Trumps

Frag - The Key of Crescents
- A man between two mirrors, an old man reflected in the mirror on his left and a child on his right, being stabbed through with two lances, which pierce the opposite mirrors, taking the youth in the leg and the old man in the face. The mirrors are cracked. There are six broken reflections of the moon in each mirror, and one in the sky. The moon is a crescent.

Torment - The Key of Torments
- Thirteen people around a fire, each with an arm extended over the fire, each hand holding the arm to the left over the fire?

Bedlam

The Neverborn/Malfeans

The Mouth of the Void?

The Void

The Outer Darkness - The Key of Eyes

The Incarna

The Gates of Ivory and Horn?

Hell

Heaven

The Shadow

Ascended Masters

The Akashic Record?

Earth

Air

Fire

Water

Darkness

Light

Judgement/Anthelios

The Enemy

The Demiurge

Malevolence

The Architect

The Principle of Adam - The Human Superconsciousness

The Principle of Eve - The Universal Unconscious

27 Trumps, with 7 being also Keys of each Suit.

#7 suits

Pip cards run from Ace to ten, then the court cards are Nemesis/Antimony and Throne. The Keys can also be counted as Court cards or as Trumps, depending on the reading.

###Patterns

####Longitudinal Patterns

13 cards long, these are patterns which dominate a Suit. The Suit itself is the most obvious longitudinal pattern.


The Ace and the Nemesis are 'the same', though the Ace is the start and the Nemesis is the inversion, turning away, rejection or antimony of the meaning of the suit.


Each Suit corresponds to one major grouping of Occult Traditions. The Seven Traditions are Hermeticism (Waves?), Arab/Christian/Druze/Zoroastrian Esotericism (Torches), Buddhist/Tibetan/Meditative (Roses), Kaballism/Early Medieval Magic (Gems?), Alchemy? (Crescents?), Voodoo/Obeah (Torments?), The Demiurge/MKUltra/The Illuminati/Freemasonry/Secret Societies/Lodges (Eyes).

The Zodiac

The Olympian Gods/Scenes from relevant myths
Aristia, Hubris, Arete, Agape
Images: Statues of ugly creatures with Gods inside

####Transverse Patterns

7 cards long, these are patterns formed across suits. The value of each card (ie Ace, 3, Nemesis) is the most obvious transverse pattern.


There is one card in each suit related to hand-to-hand martial arts, and another related to sword, dagger or similar arts.

The alchemical planets: The Sun rules Gold; The Moon, Silver; Mercury, Quicksilver/Mercury; Venus, Copper; Mars, Iron; Jupiter, Tin; Saturn, Lead
